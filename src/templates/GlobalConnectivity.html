    <h1>History of Global Connectivity</h1>
    <p>The internet has revolutionized the way we connect and communicate with each other on a global scale. Here's a brief history of global connectivity:</p>
    
    <h2>1960s - The Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was created by the United States Department of Defense. It was the first network to use packet switching, a technology that allowed data to be broken down into small packets and transmitted across multiple nodes.</p>
    <p>ARPANET initially connected four universities: Stanford, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. It was primarily used for research and military purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>1970s - The Expansion of Networks</h2>
    <p>In the 1970s, ARPANET expanded to include more universities and research institutions. This led to the development of protocols like TCP/IP, which became the foundation of the modern internet.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of TCP/IP, different networks could communicate with each other, forming a global network of interconnected networks.</p>
    
    <h2>1980s - The World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>In the 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, a system of interlinked hypertext documents that could be accessed over the internet. This marked a major milestone in global connectivity, as it made information easily accessible to people around the world.</p>
    <p>The World Wide Web introduced concepts like URLs, HTTP, and HTML, which allowed users to navigate and view web pages using web browsers.</p>
    
    <h2>1990s - The Internet Goes Mainstream</h2>
    <p>In the 1990s, the internet started to gain widespread popularity. The development of user-friendly web browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer made it easier for people to navigate the web and access online content.</p>
    <p>This decade also saw the emergence of search engines like Yahoo and Google, which made it easier to find information on the internet.</p>
    
    <h2>2000s - The Rise of Social Media</h2>
    <p>In the 2000s, social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube emerged, allowing people to connect and share information on a global scale. This further enhanced global connectivity and facilitated the exchange of ideas and cultures.</p>
    <p>These platforms revolutionized the way people communicate, enabling instant sharing of photos, videos, and thoughts with a global audience.</p>
    
    <h2>Present - The Internet of Things</h2>
    <p>Today, we are witnessing the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), where everyday objects are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect and exchange data. This has the potential to revolutionize various industries and further enhance global connectivity.</p>
    <p>The IoT has led to the development of smart homes, wearable devices, and connected cars, among other innovations.</p>
    
    <p>Global connectivity has transformed the world, enabling us to communicate, collaborate, and access information like never before. It has opened up new opportunities and challenges, shaping the way we live, work, and interact with each other.</p>
